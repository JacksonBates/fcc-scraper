## Requirements

Nodejs and NPM should be installed prior to installing the scraper tool.
If you want to download the scraper from GitHub via the command line, you'll also need Git installed - otherwise you can manually download from the GitHub page.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/jacksonbates/fcc-scraper
cd fcc-scraper
npm install
```

## Usage

`npm start` will prompt you for your username.

`npm run flush` will remove all `.zip` files from the fcc-scraper folder (just to keep things tidy if you un it often).
